### Project Summary

The goal of JPS remains the same and it is to be able to continue solving progressingly intricate jumping puzzles. Our base line project, which we have already achieved, is to solve a small 2D maze (5x4) that is only solveable through jumping. That is, the AI may choose to walk through the maze (if it leads to the optimal reward) but it can never reach the destination block if it does not utilize jumping. Our next milestone is to be able to solve a small maze with 2 floors (5x4x2). From there on, we will continue to increase the size of the maze and add more floors. Our moonshot case is for our agent to be able to solve a large maze with 3 floors (10x10x3).
